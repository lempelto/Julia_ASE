"""Atoms object.

The Atoms object can represent an isolated molecule, or a
periodically repeated structure.  It has a unit cell and
there may be periodic boundary conditions along any of the three
unit cell axes.
Information about the atoms (atomic numbers and position) is
stored in ndarrays.  Optionally, there can be information about
tags, momenta, masses, magnetic moments and charges.

In order to calculate energies, forces and stresses, a calculator
object has to attached to the atoms object.

Parameters:

symbols: str (formula) or list of str
    Can be a string formula, a list of symbols or a list of
    Atom objects.  Examples: 'H2O', 'COPt12', ['H', 'H', 'O'],
    [Atom('Ne', (x, y, z)), ...].
positions: list of xyz-positions
    Atomic positions.  Anything that can be converted to an
    ndarray of shape (n, 3) will do: [(x1,y1,z1), (x2,y2,z2),
    ...].
scaled_positions: list of scaled-positions
    Like positions, but given in units of the unit cell.
    Can not be set at the same time as positions.
numbers: list of int
    Atomic numbers (use only one of symbols/numbers).
tags: list of int
    Special purpose tags.
momenta: list of xyz-momenta
    Momenta for all atoms.
masses: list of float
    Atomic masses in atomic units.
magmoms: list of float or list of xyz-values
    Magnetic moments.  Can be either a single value for each atom
    for collinear calculations or three numbers for each atom for
    non-collinear calculations.
charges: list of float
    Initial atomic charges.
cell: 3x3 matrix or length 3 or 6 vector
    Unit cell vectors.  Can also be given as just three
    numbers for orthorhombic cells, or 6 numbers, where
    first three are lengths of unit cell vectors, and the
    other three are angles between them (in degrees), in following order:
    [len(a), len(b), len(c), angle(b,c), angle(a,c), angle(a,b)].
    First vector will lie in x-direction, second in xy-plane,
    and the third one in z-positive subspace.
    Default value: [0, 0, 0].
celldisp: Vector
    Unit cell displacement vector. To visualize a displaced cell
    around the center of mass of a Systems of atoms. Default value
    = (0,0,0)
pbc: one or three bool
    Periodic boundary conditions flags.  Examples: True,
    False, 0, 1, (1, 1, 0), (True, False, False).  Default
    value: False.
constraint: constraint object(s)
    Used for applying one or more constraints during structure
    optimization.
calculator: calculator object
    Used to attach a calculator for calculating energies and atomic
    forces.
info: dict of key-value pairs
    Dictionary of key-value pairs with additional information
    about the system.  The following keys may be used by ase:

        - spacegroup: Spacegroup instance
        - unit_cell: 'conventional' | 'primitive' | int | 3 ints
        - adsorbate_info: Information about special adsorption sites

    Items in the info attribute survives copy and slicing and can
    be stored in and retrieved from trajectory files given that the
    key is a string, the value is JSON-compatible and, if the value is a
    user-defined object, its base class is importable.  One should
    not make any assumptions about the existence of keys.

Examples:

These three are equivalent:

>>> d = 1.104  # N2 bondlength
>>> a = Atoms('N2', [(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, d)])
>>> a = Atoms(numbers=[7, 7], positions=[(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, d)])
>>> a = Atoms([Atom('N', (0, 0, 0)), Atom('N', (0, 0, d))])

FCC gold:

>>> a = 4.05  # Gold lattice constant
>>> b = a / 2
>>> fcc = Atoms('Au',
...             cell=[(0, b, b), (b, 0, b), (b, b, 0)],
...             pbc=True)

Hydrogen wire:

>>> d = 0.9  # H-H distance
>>> h = Atoms('H', positions=[(0, 0, 0)],
...           cell=(d, 0, 0),
...           pbc=(1, 0, 0))
